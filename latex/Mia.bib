	abstract = {Objective: To review efficiency metrics and patient safety data before and after implementation of a structured review process for surgical innovations. Summary Background Data: Surgical innovation ranges from minor incremental improvement to radical experimentation. Although innovation paradigms have been described, these are not widely adopted or enforced in the surgical community.
Methods: A Continuous Quality Improvement Team (CQIT) of surgical quality officers and perioperative nurses was organized to perform structured reviews of proposed new surgical devices and procedures at a large quaternary cancer care center. The CQIT process was placed to precede an established Value Analysis Team business evaluation. Pre- and post-CQIT implementation metrics of approval process efficiency and patient safety data were compared. Seven novel procedures were also vetted by the CQIT.
Results: Forty-six product requests were evaluated after CQIT implementation. Compared with 34 products evaluated prior to CQIT establishment, the total mean evaluation time decreased from 124 to 51 days (P ¼ 0.007). For new devices requiring intraoperative trial, the time between product proposal and trial decreased from a mean of 260 to 99 days (P ¼ 0.014). The rate of devicerelated complications in the pre-CQIT group was 10\% compared with 0\% postCQIT. Two devices, which administratively bypassed CQIT review, had both minor and major complications, including a mortality. Five novel procedures approved by CQIT with simulation were performed without complications.
Conclusions: Using novel algorithms, the addition of a dedicated team of surgical quality officers to the surgical innovation evaluation process improved both the efficiency and the safety associated with introducing new devices and procedures into practice.},

Computer assisted orthopedic surgery has demonstrated clear advantages for the patients, with improved placement accuracy and fewer outliers, but the intrusiveness, cost, and added complexity have limited its widespread adoption. To provide seamless computer assistance with improved immersion and a more natural surgical workﬂow, we propose an augmented-reality (AR) based navigation system for hip resurfacing. The operative femur is registered by processing depth information from the surgical site with a commercial depth camera. By coupling depth data with robotic assistance, obstacles that may obstruct the femur can be tracked and avoided automatically to reduce the chance of disruption to the surgical workﬂow. Using the registration result and the pre-operative plan, intra-operative surgical guidance is provided through a commercial AR headset so that the user can perform the operation without additional physical guides. To assess the accuracy of the navigation system, experiments of guide hole drilling were performed on femur phantoms. The position and orientation of the drilled holes were compared with the pre-operative plan, and the mean errors were found to be approximately 2 mm and 2°, results which are in line with commercial computer assisted orthopedic systems today.},

	abstract = {Background:  Breast reconstruction outcomes have traditionally been measured by evaluating the opinions of patients and surgeons.
Objectives:  Our goal was to assess the views of the general public.
Methods:  A survey was designed and distributed through a crowdsourcing website called Amazon Mechanical Turk. Questions assessed participant demographics, personal experience with breast reconstruction, perceptions on breast reconstruction, and opinions regarding aesthetics results. Responses were analyzed using chi-square test.
Results:  A total of 992 responses were collected. Most participants were female (56.1\%), white (32.1\%), aged 30 to 39 years (40.4\%), and had a bachelor’s degree (42.0\%). A total of 44.2\% had personal experience with breast reconstruction and 25.8\% with nipple reconstruction. Several aesthetic and reconstructive factors were significantly favored over others across sex, ethnicity, age group, education level, and personal experience with breast reconstruction. For instance, women were more likely to prefer reconstructed nipples (P {\textless} 0.0001), view a breast without a nipple as complete (P = 0.024) and place less importance on nipple shape (P = 0.002). Additionally, those who personally experienced nipple reconstruction were willing to undergo more procedures for a complete nipple-areola complex (P {\textless} 0.0001), to increase aesthetic results (P = 0.018), and to increase chances of nipple survival (P = 0.002).
Conclusions:  Crowdsourcing can be useful in plastic surgery and has helped identify several key findings. The importance of the nipple in reconstruction has been validated; almost three-quarters of respondents did not view a breast without a nipple as complete. The aesthetic preferences seem to support bilateral nipple-sparing reconstruction when possible. Most importantly, the respondents helped elucidate key differences in perception of aesthetic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background:  Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction.
Purpose:  To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods:  This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (TyrerCuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P , .05).
Results:  The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years 6 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95\% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P , .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01).
Conclusion:  Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model.},

One of these innovations describes patient-specific, three-dimensional (3D) printed breast molds for intraoperative use based on 3D stereophotogrammetry. In this article, we want to share our preliminary experiences with producing such templates, its clinical possibilities and limitations in practice.
Methods Patient-specific templates were designed based on 3D stereophotogrammetry images. The 3D template was fabricated using a 3D printer. During breast reconstruction, the autologous flap was placed inside the printed template to aid the surgeon in determining the shape and volume of the autologous flap creating the desired breast dimensions. Patients were 3D-photographed 6 to 9 months post-operatively.
Results Three patients with unilateral breast reconstructions showed a width difference of 0.5 cm and mean volume difference of 211 ml between the reconstructed and contralateral breasts. In the three bilateral reconstructed patients, a mean difference in breast width and volume of respectively 0.5 cm and 16 ml was found.
Conclusions Patient-specific breast templates are inexpensive and relatively easy to design, while being practical and convenient to obtain insight in the dimensions of the desired breast during reconstruction, according to the operating surgeons. Patient selection is however critical, as patients must have sufficient donor volume and/or satisfying breast shape to be able to use the template to its full potential.},
