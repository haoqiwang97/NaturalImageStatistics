# TODO: initiate 256*256*10 array to store mean of predicted color channel

# TODO: NOT possible to store the value in memory, that is too large, write it in excel or csv

# TODO: an excel for a color, containing 10 sheets, or maybe 20 (another sheet is for the number, to calculate mean)
#  , each sheet represents a level of contrast, so we just add them and then calculate mean
